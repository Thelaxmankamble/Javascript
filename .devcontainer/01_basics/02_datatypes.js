// these below mentioned are primitive data types
// data types(call by value)
// numbers=> 2 to power 53 is a range for numbers
//boolean=> true/false
//bigInt=> used for huge numbers
//string=> ""
//null=> standalone value for eg suppose i want to give the temperature but i dont have it for now so i will give the variable value as null not '0' because zero is a value .
//undefined=> value not assigned yet. for eg : let state; state has not been assigned any value.


// non-primitive(call by reference) data types are:-
// Arrays, functions, objects

console.log(typeof undefined);// undefined is a type itself
console.log(typeof null);//its of type object
